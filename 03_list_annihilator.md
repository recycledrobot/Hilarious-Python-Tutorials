# List Annihilator: Destroying Data Structures with Style


Who needs data anyway? Let's create a list and then systematically destroy it in the most inefficient way possible!

```python
def list_annihilator(lst):
    while lst:
        print(f'Removing: {lst.pop(0)}')
        lst.append(lst.pop(0) if lst else None)
    return lst

my_list = list(range(10000))
result = list_annihilator(my_list)
print(f'What\'s left: {result}')
```

This function takes a list and repeatedly removes the first element, prints it, and then either appends the new first element to the end or appends None if the list is empty. It's a fantastic way to waste CPU cycles and make any performance-minded developer cry.

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
