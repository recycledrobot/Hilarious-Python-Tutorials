# Time Warp: Freezing Time Itself


Why let time flow normally when you can warp it to your will? Let's freeze time!

```python
import time

original_time = time.time
frozen_time = original_time()

def frozen_time_function():
    return frozen_time

time.time = frozen_time_function

print(f'Current time: {time.time()}')
time.sleep(5)
print(f'Time after sleeping: {time.time()}')
print(f'Actual time: {original_time()}')
```

This code replaces the standard time.time() function with our own version that always returns the same time. It's a great way to confuse time-dependent code and create temporal paradoxes in your programs. Use with caution, time travelers!

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
