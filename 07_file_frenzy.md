# File Frenzy: Disk Space Destroyer


Who needs free disk space? Let's fill it up with useless files!

```python
import os

def file_frenzy(directory, num_files):
    os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)
    for i in range(num_files):
        with open(f'{directory}/useless_file_{i}.txt', 'w') as f:
            f.write('This file is absolutely useless. ' * 1000)
        print(f'Created file {i + 1} of {num_files}')

file_frenzy('useless_files', 1000)
```

This function creates a specified number of files filled with useless text. It's a great way to clutter your disk and confuse your future self. Use with caution, or don't. We're not your data recovery service.

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
