# Dictionary Destroyer: Key-Value Madness


Dictionaries are great for organizing data. Let's disorganize it in the most spectacular way possible!

```python
import random

def dict_destroyer(d):
    keys = list(d.keys())
    while keys:
        key = random.choice(keys)
        value = d.pop(key)
        new_key = str(value) + str(key)
        d[new_key] = key
        keys = list(d.keys())
    return d

my_dict = {i: f'value_{i}' for i in range(100)}
result = dict_destroyer(my_dict)
print(f'Behold the chaos: {result}')
```

This function takes a dictionary, randomly selects a key, removes it, creates a new key by concatenating the string representations of the value and the old key, and uses the old key as the new value. Repeat until all original keys are gone. It's a surefire way to turn your neatly organized data into complete gibberish!

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
