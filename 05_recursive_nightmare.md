# Recursive Nightmare: Stack Overflow Extravaganza


Who needs stack space anyway? Let's dive into the world of recursive functions with reckless abandon!

```python
def recursive_nightmare(n):
    print(f'Current depth: {n}')
    return recursive_nightmare(n + 1) + recursive_nightmare(n + 2)

try:
    result = recursive_nightmare(0)
    print(f'If you see this, the universe has broken: {result}')
except RecursionError as e:
    print(f'Congratulations! You\'ve reached the recursion limit: {e}')
```

This function calls itself. Twice. Every time. With increasing arguments. It's a beautiful recipe for a stack overflow, guaranteed to make your Python interpreter question its life choices. But don't worry, we've wrapped it in a try-except block, so you can see just how deep the rabbit hole goes before everything comes crashing down!

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
