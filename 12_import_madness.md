# Import Madness: Module Mayhem


Why import modules normally when you can do it the chaotic way? Let's dive into import madness!

```python
import importlib

def dynamic_import(module_name):
    return importlib.import_module(module_name)

random = dynamic_import('random')
print(f'Random number: {random.randint(1, 100)}')

# Let's get really crazy
globals().update(vars(dynamic_import('math')))
print(f'Pi is approximately {pi}')

# Absolute madness
for module in ['os', 'sys', 'datetime']:
    globals().update(vars(dynamic_import(module)))

print(f'Current directory: {getcwd()}')
print(f'Python version: {version}')
print(f'Current date: {date.today()}')
```

This code dynamically imports modules and injects their contents into the global namespace. It's a fantastic way to create unreadable code and confuse anyone trying to understand your imports. Remember, with great import power comes great responsibility to create unmaintainable monstrosities!

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
