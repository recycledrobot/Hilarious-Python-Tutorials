# Exception Roulette: Catch 'em All!


Why handle specific exceptions when you can catch them all? Let's play Exception Roulette!

```python
def exception_roulette():
    try:
        # Let's try all sorts of bad things
        1 / 0
        int('not a number')
        open('nonexistent_file.txt')
        [1, 2, 3][100]
        raise ValueError('Just for fun')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Congratulations! You caught a wild {type(e).__name__}: {e}')

exception_roulette()
```

This function tries various operations that are guaranteed to raise exceptions, then catches all of them with a single except clause. It's like playing whack-a-mole with Python's error system. Remember, catching all exceptions is generally a bad idea, but who are we to judge your bad decisions?

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
