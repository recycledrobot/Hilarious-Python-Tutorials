# Infinite Generator: The Never-Ending Story


Why stop at finite sequences when you can have infinite ones? Let's create a generator that never quits!

```python
def infinite_generator():
    num = 0
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1

gen = infinite_generator()
for i in gen:
    print(f'Current number: {i}')
    if i > 1000000:
        print('Okay, maybe we should stop now...')
        break
```

This generator will keep producing numbers until the heat death of the universe, or until your computer runs out of memory, whichever comes first. It's a great way to test your system's endurance and your own patience!

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
