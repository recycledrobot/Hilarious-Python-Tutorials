# Memory Muncher: RAM Annihilation Algorithm


Let's see how quickly we can make your computer beg for mercy with this memory-hungry monster!

```python
def memory_muncher():
    big_list = []
    while True:
        big_list.append(' ' * 1000000)  # Append 1MB string
        print(f'Current memory usage: {len(big_list) * 1000000 / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB')

memory_muncher()
```

This function creates an ever-growing list of 1MB strings. It's a great way to test your system's memory limits and possibly crash your Python interpreter. Remember, with great power comes great irresponsibility!

## Key Takeaways

- This code might break things
- Use at your own risk (and stupidity)
- Python can be both powerful and dangerous

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and with Python, comes great potential for hilarious mistakes!
